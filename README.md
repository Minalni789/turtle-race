# turtle-race
This program is a turtle race betting game, where the user can bet on which turtle will win the race. 
The user can enter a color to bet on, and then six turtles of different colors will race across the screen from left to right.
The turtles move randomly a certain distance forward each time, and the first turtle to reach the right side of the screen is declared the winner. If the user's bet matches the color of the winning turtle, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.
